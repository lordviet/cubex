Asset:

The asset consists of a fantasy Stone Hammer model with subtle runic engravings. The asset uses a realistic styled texturing, similar in style to the ones used in more modern first-person fantasy games or AAA RPG games.

Although heavy on high-frequency details, the base model and normal map should work fine with other texturing styles (like cartoon or fantasy MMO).

--------------------------------------------------
Model:

The asset includes four different LODs (Low, Medium, High, Ultra), as well as four cosmetic model variants (Normal, No Spikes, No Ornament, No Ornament & No Spikes). Their respective Triangle counts:

Name - Triangles

Low - 132
Medium - 464
High - 1364
Ultra - 6148

Low (No Spikes) - 108
Medium (No Spikes) - 416
High (No Spikes) - 1204
Ultra (No Spikes) - 5308

Low (No Ornament) - 108
Medium (No Ornament) - 364
High (No Ornament) - 1076
Ultra (No Ornament) - 4700

Low (No Ornament & No Spikes) - 84
Medium (No Ornament & No Spikes) - 316
High (No Ornament & No Spikes) - 916
Ultra (No Ornament & No Spikes) - 3860


On average each LOD jumps between ~300% and 400% in Triangle Count. The goal was to offer a wide range of options from Mobile to very detailed models used in first-person camera games.

--------------------------------------------------
Texture:

The Textures follow a Specular Color PBR Workflow. The asset includes an Albedo, Specular and Normal Map, with the following specifications:

Albedo Map: 1024x1024 with AO in the Alpha Channel
Specular Map: 512x512, Specular Color Workflow, Gloss in the Alpha Channel
Normal Map: 1024x1024

Additionally, the asset includes a dark Iron skin with an additional Albedo and Specular maps, and a "No Cracks" Albedo and Normal Maps to use with some of the variants. The Iron textures are designed so that they can work in any model.
